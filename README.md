# React App in Docker

This guide explains how to set up, build, and run a React app inside Docker.

## Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your system.

---

## 1. Create a `Dockerfile`
Inside your project folder, create a file named `Dockerfile` (no extension) and add the following content:

```dockerfile
# Use Node.js as the base image
FROM node:20-alpine

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json first (for better caching)
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the project files
COPY . .

# Expose port 3000 for the React app
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the React development server
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

---

## 2. Create a `.dockerignore` File
To keep the image clean and prevent unnecessary files from being copied, create a `.dockerignore` file inside your project folder and add:

```
node_modules
build
.dockerignore
.git
.gitignore
```

---

## 3. Build and Run the Docker Container

### **Step 1: Build the Docker Image**
Run the following command inside your project folder:
```sh
docker build -t my-react-app .
```

### **Step 2: Run the React App in Docker**
```sh
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd):/app -w /app my-react-app
```

Now, open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

---

## 4. Why Use This Approach?
**Easier to manage** → No need to type long commands every time.  
**Consistent setup** → Anyone can build and run the app with Docker.  
**Modular approach** → Easily extendable for production and CI/CD.  

---

## 5. Troubleshooting
**Port 3000 is already in use?** Run:
```sh
docker ps  # Find running containers
```
Then stop the container using:
```sh
docker stop <container_id>
```
Alternatively, run the app on a different port:
```sh
docker run -p 3001:3000 my-react-app
```

Now you're all set! Modify your React files inside your project, and changes will reflect automatically. Let me know if you need any improvements!
